## About my self

I am an undergraduate study at <a href="https://www.ccg.unam.mx/"><span style="color:  #b433ff;"> *Centro de Ciencias Genómicas*</span></a>, UNAM. I am interested on things related to bioinformatics, data science and machine learning. I enjoy programming during free time, specially in R and Python. By now, I do not have a specific project, but I am looking forward to start one soon. I love learning new things, reading, listening to music and drinking coffee.
